# Machine learning for early prediction of ICU colonization with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales: a SMOTE-enhanced approach

This study aims to predict 'CPE or not' by developing machine learning models for the isolation of patients who are suspected of infection.

This project presents interpretable machine learning models to predict colonization by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) at the time of ICU admission. By using structured electronic medical record (EMR) data and applying SMOTE to address class imbalance, we aimed to support early infection control decisions in critical care settings.

## üß† Overview
- **Goal**: Predict whether an ICU-admitted patient is colonized with CPE using clinical and demographic data.
- **Approach**: Logistic regression and other machine learning algorithms trained on a 2022 ICU dataset, validated using 2023 data.
- **Key Tools**: SMOTE for imbalance correction, SHAP for model interpretability.

## üìä Datasets
- **Training**: 1,992 ICU admissions (2022)  
  - CPE+: 220 (11%), CPE‚Äì: 1,772 (89%)
- **Validation**: 2,923 ICU admissions (2023)  
  - CPE+: 233 (8%), CPE‚Äì: 2,690 (92%)
